- Based on [EIP-5553 (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5553)]
- Each IP asset i deployed as its own smart contract on chain
- Each IP Asset (songs) has its own token limited to 100 units, which is spread across the creators of that asset (band members etc.)
- Royalty payments are paid to the IP asset directly, and the protocol takes care of paying out the relative share to each owner of the tokens
- Each store is deployed as its own smart contract on-chain and can be managed independently
- Stores are managed by a **Root Registry** contract
- Licensing options and pricing are set separately for each store by the store owners
